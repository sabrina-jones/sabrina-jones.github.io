“Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.” 
― Abraham Lincoln


Before I began my application, I started planning. I reviewed the project requirements and tossed around ideas of an application that I could develop that would 1) meet the requirements 2) be creative and 3) be related to a topic that I enjoy. I wanted to create a family tree application, but after matching my plan with the requirements, I felt that the idea would not work well. So, I landed on a concert application. This application allows users to create concerts and leave a review. The best concert ever will be the users most highly rated concert that they've attended. 

By building this application, I gained a better understanding of using the Devise gem to create the User model as well as implementing omniauth for my application. I struggled most with getting omniauth to work as I am using cloud9 and found that i needed to include user in the url. What I enjoyed most was being able to use all of the things that I've learned throught my time working on creating CRUD applications to create my very own Best Concert Ever App!
