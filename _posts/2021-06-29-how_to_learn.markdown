One of the things that I've found most difficult is putting myself in the mindset of learning. There is something to learning that, it seems as we age, takes a bit more effort. We have so many struggles like our finances, our futures, our families, our loved ones to think about that distracts us. This takes away important brain power that is required for learning new things. 

I have learned however, that our brains are very powerful, we have the ability to trick our minds into being curious about new topics and new problems. I found this especially helpful when working through css and html. I've never been one for styling and I've never really enjoyed that part of software development. But, I've learned to learn in a sense. I find things about css and styling, like Material UI that makes learning so much more enjoyable. I have tricked myself into loving styling. 

As I continue on as a lifelong student, I believe this skill will help me on the days where I think I've got nothing left, or days that I can't focus, it's that curiosity that keeps us going.
