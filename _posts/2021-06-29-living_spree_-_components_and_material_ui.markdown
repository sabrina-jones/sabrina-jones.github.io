Living Spree is an application that allows users to add and view events that are free or nearly free in their area. Most of all, it is an app that allows users to share experiences. With the creation of this app, I was able to learn a lot and I also gained some more front end experience, especially using React, Redux, and Material UI. 

The backend for this application was quite simple, and since I've used Rails for some time now, setting up the backend was quite simple and fairly quick for me. The models, controllers , routes and gems are all second nature. 

React and Redux have been a challenge. It was such a difficult section to work through. While I was able to get more experience with using the redux store and react stateful and stateless components, I believe that there is truly a lot more for me to learn when it comes to React and all that it has to offer a developer. I plan to go back and review the sections especially when Redux comes into play. I can see the advantage of React components much like the advantage of cleaning up styling with something like Material UI. 

I have always struggled with understanding css, Material UI certainly came to the rescue. It allowed me to style my application in a way that makes it look more presentable to the users. This plugin also made it very quick and easy for me to do so. The experience that I gained by using Material UI was reading styling documentation. I learned a host of new tags that I know I will be able to use in the future.
