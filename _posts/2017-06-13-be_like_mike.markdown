Michael Jordan is legendary. He's magical, he has inspired many people around the world. It was through his basketball career that he made us all believe that we could fly. The truth is, I am a huge fan of basketball but even more than that, it has been my goal to find a way to inspire people around me, just like Mike. I still remember the song from Gatorade's be like Mike commercial of the early 90's. At that point in my life,  I honestly thought that I wanted to be like Mike. I wanted to be a lot of things at that age. I wanted to be an astronaut, a doctor, and  a ballerina. 

Only later, after testing and failures, I finally understood  what I actually wanted during that time. I wanted to show others through my work, just like Mike, that nothing is magic. It takes passion and dedication and curiosity and failing and learning. The reason that I decide to code is simple. I wanted to find a way to solve problems and while doing that, inspire others to do the same. The thing is, most of the people that I've come across often believe that coding is magic and only reserved for those people that are "super smart" but that is not the case. We all solve problems every day, so if this is something we do naturally, we all have the same ability to solve problems through coding.
