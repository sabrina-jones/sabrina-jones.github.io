I started working on my Sinatra app almost 4 months ago. To be honest. It was done 4 months ago. However, I wanted it to be perfect. So I made changes here and there, but that was not the point of this exercise. The main point was to learn to develop a Sinatra Application. Not to develop the most perfect Sinatra Application the first time around. 

My workout application allows a user to sign up and sign in. From there they can veiw all previously created workout plans but they may only modify the plans that they own. This app is meant to allow users to share plans and work as a community to get fit. 

While creating this app, and finally coming to terms with the fact that I should be working towards progress and not perfection. I understood that the same goes with working out. If you are looking for perfection, you may find yourself 4 months later wishing that you had just started, you would have made progress. 

In other words, the search for perfection oftentimes leaves us stalled. That is not what the learning process looks like. To learn, we must try and fail. Aiming for perfection does not allow this process to take place. Working out and coding are very similar in that way. You must train your muscles, and you find that you fail more than you succeed but that is when you grow. When you fail you grow.
